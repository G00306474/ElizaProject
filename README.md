# ElizaProject
## A chatterbox program built in go
My name is Kevin Moran and this is project for  Data Rep & Quer in software devlopment yr 3 in GMIT

The ask for this project was:
In this project you will create a chatbot web application in Go. Users will be able to visit the web application through their browser, type in sentences such as “Hi, my name is John.” and the web application will reply with sentences such as “Hello John, how are you?” You are free to use your artistic license in creating the chatbot, such as by giving it a certain type of personality, but you should be guided by the ELIZA program. If you wish to use any technique to enhance your chatbot, such as machine learning methods, that is okay as long as the chatbot works. However, reasonable care must be taken to ensure that the chatbot you create does not act in an offensive manner, and students are reminded of the GMIT Code of Student Conduct.
